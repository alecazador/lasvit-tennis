Due to this challenge Brett has created a unique way of looking at the world, how he problem solves and how he approaches the entire learning process. He was and still is constantly finding new ways to learn 'simple' skills. To understand why the body moves in certain ways and even how the use of language changes the understanding of the task at hand. After a year of traveling and playing, Brett knew where he wanted to be and what he wanted to do. Coach. Not simply follow what other coaches were doing but create a way for each person to learn in the most optimal way. Mold the learning process and acquire knowledge in an enjoyable and rewarding way."

One is the expense, unless you're in a country that offers a payment scheme for university or a free university, university can be expensive. Now in the United States, university is super expensive if you're going to a well-known school. Now, this isn't so much of the issue, but in places like Australia, New Zealand, England, Europe, pretty much most places in the world. If you're playing tennis still and studying full-time on campus at a university, you're going to really, really struggle. The United States offers a system that you can combine both. Really elite-level tennis, really elite level schools."

You need to sit in an SAT. We'll explain all that down below, but it's not crazy hard to achieve.

I didn't grow into my body until I was a little bit sort of 19/20. After going to the gym, getting a bit stronger, getting faster. I wasn't really ready to compete until I was 20 years old, basically. So for me, college maybe was the better option and I should have taken that. It would have given me two years of study, two years at a really high level of tennis and two years to mature and grow into my body and my mind, I would have been much more grounded and more performance-ready at 20 than 18 going into tour. You can always leave college. It's very hard to go back when you're 22 or 23, cause they have some age restrictions and it's harder to go to the US for college reasons. So for parents out there who are trying to find the right balance with their child, whether tennis needs to be the priority or not is a really interesting discussion and it's not something I can answer for you. It's got to come from you and your family. The dynamic between you and your child and that conversation. But what I can tell you is that most children that study full-time without any escape, really struggle between the years of 18 to 22, there's a lot going on, they're becoming an adult, they're out in the world and what I think tennis or any sport really is. But in our situation, tennis brings that grounding and grounding is such an important thing for someone who maybe has just gone overseas to study, or is trying to pursue a career that is really intense and involves a lot of hours sitting at a desk, tennis could be a great escape.\n\n"

You may be number four in the team and you only have 25% of your sports scholarship covered, but you're an exceptional student and you have a hundred percent of that covet. They are split into two, for example, a good friend of mine who I grew up playing with, went to college on a tennis scholarship. I believe he was number six in the team and had 25 or 30% on his sports, but he's a very good student. In the end, he had a zero sports scholarship after two years and had a complete full scholarship with academics. He continued playing on the team and he just played matches and training. So he went the other way when he was at college and took the academic pursuit. I had another friend who went to college down in North Carolina, [00:06:00] and he went the other way where he had a really good starting position with academics and had a hundred percent scholarship.

There's nothing stopping a parent from doing all the paperwork, filming all the required video resumes, the Encore presentation, packaging it up, contacting all the universities, the Scouts, et cetera. Completely can do that. It's super time consuming, really, really tough. And knowing the people to contact can be a real pain in the behind. So what we can do for you is to help you with that process. So essentially become like an agent on your behalf. We help give you all the tools to do that. So we film the video if we can, if we're in close proximity to you, if not, we'll give you a full video guideline on the best angles to film, cameras to use, how to mount on the fence, et cetera."

Then it's a perfect time to do it because in some cases, and in some countries you have to change your high school subjects to give you the right amount of points for your grade point average because, in the United States, they use a grade point average. To give you the option of going to the United States. So for example, for me, I had to change in year 10 when I was 16 to do Physics at school because I needed an extra mass on my grade point average and my report to help me get into college. So I did get into a college and sign. I just decided not to go for me at the time."

You can, however, approach the learning process with a scientific mind. A willingness to understand and grow. The scientific mind is a mind that searches for truth through trial and error. Through the use of other scientific studies, from other known knowledge bases, from educators well versed in the field. The crucial factor is, learning continues to grow and develop. This growth mindset will develop all areas of one's life, limit common overtraining or burnout issues in teenagers and create processes you can use time and time again."
